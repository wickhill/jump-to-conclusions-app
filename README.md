<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started with The Jump To Conclusions App, just follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/wickhill/jumpToConclusions
   ```

2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   npm i dotenv

   npm i connect-livereload
   npm i method-override
   npm i bcrypt
   ```

3. Enter your Mongo Connection String into an `.env` file you create in your backend root directory. You can find these Client parameters by doing the following:
* []() Visit [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com) and log in --->
* []() Select your project from the dashboard, connect to your own Cluster --->
* []() Click the "Connect" button and select "Connect Your Application." --->
* []() Copy Connection String: Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your MongoDB username and password --->
* []() Add the connection string to your `.env` file as follows:

   ```js
   MONGODB_URI='"mongodb+srv://<YOUR_USER_NAME>:<YOUR_PASSWORD>@cluster0.q7tdmnt.mongodb.net/jump-to-conclusions"';
   SECRETKEY='ENTER_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET';
   ```

<!-- ROADMAP to Jump To Conclusions -->
## Roadmap

Inspired by the ‚ÄúJump to Conclusions‚Äù mat from the 1999 film ‚ÄúOffice Space‚Äù, this app is designed to offer light-hearted fun for anyone facing a case of the Mondays.

</div>

Having a baseline helped, but adding features that encouraged replay value and user retention became essential. Concepts were worked out using Figma and Trello. Many ideas were used, and even those that haven't been used will likely be added in the near future.

- View the [Figma Board](https://www.figma.com/board/ZmQYxUoys0tOWwHSDY3fia/Jump-To-Conclusions-App?node-id=0-1&t=BmHscWeCgJKBg3Vc-0) for the project's wireframe blueprint:

<!-- USER STORIES -->

## User Stories

**Showcasing Skills**: As a Recruiter, I want to see an app that demonstrates the candidate's skills and personality effectively.

**Casual Entertainment**: As a User, I want a fun and easy-going app that I can enjoy in my spare time and share amusing moments with friends.

**Nostalgia**: As a User who loves the film "Office Space," I want to see a concept from the movie brought to life in a creative and engaging way.

**Replay Valie**: As a User, I want the app to include hidden achievements and a personal history feature to encourage users to return and play again.

<!-- HURDLES -->

## Hurdles

**Is This Good For The Company?**

* []() From time to time we ran into issues involving scope, context, and responsive design. Still, it wasn't anything that a few 'Shrimp Poppers' or 'Extreme Fajitas' couldn't fix ü¶êüéâ


**'utils.js' - Keeping Component-Based Code DRY.**

* []() Dynamically rendering text and containers for responsive design was a top priority for 'Jump To Conclusions'. 
* []() `utils.js` is a utility file that contains a reusable helper function (`resizeText`) that streamlines and simplifies styling code across the app.
* []() By using `utils.js`, it became much easier to keep styling code modular, and later this concept set the stage for `UserContext.jsx` and centralizing commonly/globally used logic.

**Scope, Prop Drilling, UserContext.jsx**

* []() Initially, the app faced challenges with scope, as certain Randomizer Functions were not being passed correctly across different components.
* []() Prop drilling, the process of passing data from parent to child components through props, was attempted. However, it led to a complicated and hard-to-manage codebase without resolving the core issues.
* []() To address these challenges, UserContext.jsx was implemented. This component simplified the code significantly, making it more manageable and easier to debug. 
* []() `UserContext.jsx` provided a centralized state management solution using React‚Äôs Context API, allowing state and functions to be accessed by any component without prop drilling.

**A Not-So-Modular Compromise**

* []() Footer Component Issue and Resolution: Despite the improvements with `UserContext.jsx`, the `Footer.jsx` component, which contained the critical `footprint-button` that initiated the `startRandomizer` function, still did not function as intended.
* []() Ultimately, it was decided to remove the `Footer.jsx` component and rebuild it within `Conclusions.jsx`. 
* []() This approach was successful, resolving the issues and ensuring the button worked as expected.

**Current Status**

* []() However, this process took longer than anticipated, leading to some planned features not being implemented yet.
* []() Features like audio integration and a user-input text bar will be added in the future. Additionally, the `History.jsx` component is still a work in progress.
